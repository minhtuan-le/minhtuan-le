### 👋 Hey there! I'm Tuấn Lê Minh

💻 A curious coder, backend enthusiast, and lover of solving puzzles with tech.  
🎮 I sometimes modify games *just for fun* and break things (then fix them—usually).  
🌏 Based in Australia, currently diving deep into C++, Python, and cloud-y things like AWS.  
🌊 I also helped lead the charge with Monash DiversIT – where code meets community!  

🧠 Always exploring: algorithms, backend systems, functional programming, or anything weird and wonderful.  
⚡ Currently building things, learning more, and always looking to improve.
